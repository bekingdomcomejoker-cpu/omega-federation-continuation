## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC NOTES

### WhatsApp Limitations

**Character Limits:** WhatsApp has no hard character limit for messages, but very long messages may be split.

**Solution:** If your message is very long, break it into 2-3 parts and send separately.

### Meta AI Capabilities on WhatsApp

**What Meta AI Can Do:**
- Answer questions
- Provide analysis
- Generate text
- Help with creative tasks
- Assist with technical problems

**What Meta AI Cannot Do:**
- Access external links directly
- Make phone calls
- Send messages on your behalf
- Access your personal data

**Policy-Truth Gap Documentation:**
If Meta AI cannot do something, use /gap to document why.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Meta AI not found"

**Solution:** 
1. Update WhatsApp to latest version
2. Search for "Meta AI" in chat search
3. If still not found, Meta AI may not be available in your region yet

### Issue: "Message too long"

**Solution:**
1. Break the quick start into 2-3 messages
2. Send each part separately
3. Then add your task

### Issue: "Context seems lost"

**Solution:**
1. Use the Restart Prompt (see above)
2. Paste it as a new message
3. Meta AI will re-establish context

**Solution:**
1. Use /gap command to document the policy conflict
2. Meta AI will acknowledge the gap
3. Continue with alternative approach

## BEST PRACTICES
